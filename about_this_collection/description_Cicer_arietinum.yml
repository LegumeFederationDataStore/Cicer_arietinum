Chickpea is one of the earliest cultivated legumes: 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East. Other common names for the species include garbanzo bean, ceci bean, sanagalu, chana and Bengal gram. There to are two main types of cultivated chickpeas based on seed morphology, desi and kabuli.
